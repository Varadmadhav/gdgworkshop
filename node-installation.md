# 🔧 Node.js & npm Installation Guide (Required for Backend)

> ⚠️ Please complete these steps before attending the Backend & Deployment session of the workshop.

---

## 📥 Step 1: Download Node.js

Go to the official Node.js website:

👉 [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

Download the **LTS (Long Term Support)** version.

* The LTS version is stable
* Recommended for backend development

---

## ⚙️ Step 2: Install Node.js

After downloading, open the setup file.

During installation:

➡️ Click **Next** for all the steps.

Make sure the following option is checked:

✔️ **Add to PATH**

> ⚠️ This option is important, otherwise Node.js will not run in the terminal.

---

## 🧪 Step 3: Verify Installation

After installation, open **VS Code**.

Open the terminal using:

```bash
Ctrl + `
```

Run the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

If a version number is displayed, Node.js has been successfully installed.

---

Now run this command:

```bash
npm -v
```

This will check the npm version which is used to install dependencies.

---

## ✅ You're Ready!

If both commands show version numbers,
your system is ready for backend setup.

---

## ❌ Facing Any Errors?

If any error occurs:

* Reinstall Node.js carefully
* Ensure that the **Add to PATH** option is selected
